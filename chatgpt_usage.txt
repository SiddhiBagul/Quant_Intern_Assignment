# AI Usage Transparency Note

## Usage
I utilized an AI Assistant (Google DeepMind's Antigravity) to act as a pair programmer for this assignment.

## Prompts & Interactions
- **Architecture Design**: Used AI to brainstorm the modular architecture (separating ingestion from frontend) to ensure scalability.
- **Code Generation**:
    - "Create a robust Python WebSocket client for Binance" -> Used for `backend/ingestion.py`.
    - "Implement OLS hedge ratio and ADF test in Python" -> Used for `backend/analytics.py`.
    - "Build a dark-mode Streamlit dashboard with real-time updates" -> Used for `frontend/app.py`.
- **Debugging**: Utilized AI to fix minor syntax errors and ensure correct parameter passing between modules.
- **Documentation**: AI helped draft the README and Architecture Diagram prompt.

## Reasoning
The use of AI accelerated the boilerplate setup (WebSocket handling, Streamlit layout), allowing more time to focus on the quantitative logic (Spread, Z-Score) and system design (SQLite indexing, modularity). All code was reviewed and tested to ensure accuracy.
